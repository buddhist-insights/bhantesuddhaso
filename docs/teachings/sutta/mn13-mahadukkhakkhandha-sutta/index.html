<p align="left">Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at SƒÅvatthi, at Jeta‚Äôs Grove, in AnƒÅthapi·πá·∏çika‚Äôs Park. Then many monks dressed in the morning, took their bowls and robes, and entered SƒÅvatthi for alms. Then it occurred to those monks, ‚ÄúIt is too early to go for alms in SƒÅvatthi. Perhaps we will approach the park where there are wanderers from other religions.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">Then those monks approached the park where there were wanderers from other religions and conversed with them. When the appropriate polite conversation was finished, they sat to one side. When the monks were seated to one side, the wanderers said to them, ‚ÄúVenerables, the contemplative Gotama teaches the complete understanding of sensuality, and we also teach the complete understanding of sensuality. The contemplative Gotama teaches the complete understanding of bodies<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote1sym" name="sdfootnote1anc"><sup>1</sup></a>, and we also teach the complete understanding of bodies. The contemplative Gotama teaches the complete understanding of feelings, and we also teach the complete understanding of feelings. Venerables, what is the distinction, the difference, the variation between the teachings and instructions given by the contemplative Gotama and those given by us?‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">The monks neither approved of nor rejected the wanderers‚Äô statement. Instead, they rose from their seats and left, thinking ‚ÄúWe will understand the meaning of this in the Blessed One‚Äôs presence.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">Then after those monks had gone for alms in SƒÅvatthi, finished their meal, and returned from their alms-round, they approached the Blessed One, paid respects to him, and sat to one side. When they were seated to one side, those monks said to the Blessed One, ‚ÄúBhante, this morning we dressed, took our bowls and robes, and entered SƒÅvatthi for alms‚Ä¶ we rose from our seats and left, thinking ‚ÄòWe will understand the meaning of this in the Blessed One‚Äôs presence.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúMonks, when wanderers from other religions say that, this is what you should say: ‚ÄòVenerable, in relation to sensuality, what is the gratification, what is the drawback, and what is the escape? In relation to bodies, what is the gratification, what is the drawback, and what is the escape? In relation to feelings, what is the gratification, what is the drawback, and what is the escape?‚Äô Monks, when wanderers from other religions are asked this, they will be unable to reply and will only get more distressed. For what reason? Monks, it is not their domain. Monks, I do not see anyone in this world of devas, mƒÅras, and brahmas, in this generation of contemplatives and brahmins with its celestial and human beings, that is able to satisfy the mind with an answer to these questions ‚Äì except a TathƒÅgata, a disciple of a TathƒÅgata, or someone who has heard it from them.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúMonks, in relation to sensuality, what is the gratification? Monks, there are these five strands of sensuality. What five? Sights cognizable by the eye which are desirable, enjoyable, pleasant, lovable, sensual, and exciting; sounds cognizable by the ear‚Ä¶ fragrances cognizable by the nose‚Ä¶ flavors cognizable by the tongue‚Ä¶ tangibles cognizable by the body which are desirable, enjoyable, pleasant, lovable, sensual, and exciting ‚Äì monks, these are the five strands of sensuality. Monks, the pleasure and elation which arises dependent on these five strands of sensuality is the gratification in relation to sensuality.</p>
