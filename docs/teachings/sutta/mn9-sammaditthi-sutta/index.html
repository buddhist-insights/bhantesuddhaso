<p align="left">Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at SƒÅvatthi, in Jeta&#8217;s Grove, at AnƒÅthapi·πá·∏çika&#8217;s Park. There Venerable SƒÅriputta addressed the monks: ‚ÄúVenerable monks!‚Äù ‚ÄúVenerable,‚Äù those monks replied to Venerable SƒÅriputta. Venerable SƒÅriputta said this:</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúVenerables, it is said, &#8216;Right perspective, right perspective.&#8217; Venerables, how does a noble disciple have right perspective, [how is] his perspective upright,<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote1sym" name="sdfootnote1anc"><sup>1</sup></a> [how is] he possessed of certainty and confidence in the Dhamma, [how is] he one who has arrived at this true Dhamma?‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúVenerable, we might come from far away to learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of Venerable SƒÅriputta. It would be excellent if Venerable SƒÅriputta would make evident the meaning of this statement. After hearing it from Venerable SƒÅriputta, the monks will remember it.‚Äù ‚ÄúTherefore, Venerables, listen and carefully pay attention. I will speak.‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, Venerable,‚Äù those monks replied to Venerable SƒÅriputta. Venerable SƒÅriputta said this:</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúVenerables, when a noble disciple understands the unwholesome, understands the root of the unwholesome, understands the wholesome, understands the root of the wholesome ‚Äì this, Venerables, is how a noble disciple has right perspective, [how] his perspective is upright, [how] he is possessed of certainty and confidence in the Dhamma, [how] he is one who has arrived at this true Dhamma. But, Venerables, what is the unwholesome? What is the root of the unwholesome? What is the wholesome? What is the root of the wholesome?</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúVenerables, killing living beings is unwholesome. Theft is unwholesome. Sexual misconduct is unwholesome. False speech is unwholesome. Malicious speech is unwholesome. Harsh speech is unwholesome. Frivolous prattle is unwholesome. Covetousness is unwholesome. Ill will is unwholesome. Wrong perspective is unwholesome. Venerables, this is called &#8216;the unwholesome.&#8217; And, Venerables, what is the root of the unwholesome? Greed is a root of the unwholesome, hatred is a root of the unwholesome, delusion is a root of the unwholesome ‚Äì Venerables, this is called &#8216;the root of the unwholesome.&#8217;</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúAnd, Venerables, what is the wholesome? Abstinence from killing living beings is wholesome. Abstinence from theft is wholesome. Abstinence from sexual misconduct is wholesome. Abstinence from false speech is wholesome. Abstinence from malicious speech is wholesome. Abstinence from harsh speech is wholesome. Abstinence from frivolous prattle is wholesome. Non-covetousness is wholesome. Non-ill will is wholesome. Right perspective is wholesome. Venerables, this is called &#8216;the wholesome.&#8217; And, Venerables, what is the root of the wholesome? Non-greed is a root of the wholesome, non-hatred is a root of the wholesome, non-delusion is a root of the wholesome ‚Äì Venerables, this is called &#8216;the root of the wholesome.&#8217;</p>
