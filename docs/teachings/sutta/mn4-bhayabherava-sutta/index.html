<p align="left">Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at SƒÅvatthi, at Jeta‚Äôs Grove, in AnƒÅthapi·πá·∏çika‚Äôs Park. Then the Brahmin JƒÅ·πáussoni approached the Blessed One and greeted him. When the appropriate polite conversation was finished, he sat to one side. When he was seated to one side, the Brahmin JƒÅ·πáussoni said to the Blessed One, ‚ÄúSir Gotama, of the gentlemen renunciates who go forth from home to homelessness because<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote1sym" name="sdfootnote1anc"><sup>1</sup></a> of Sir Gotama, Sir Gotama is their leader, Sir Gotama is their helper<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote2sym" name="sdfootnote2anc"><sup>2</sup></a>, Sir Gotama is their advisor; and the populace follows the example of Sir Gotama.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSo it is, Brahmin; so it is, Brahmin. Brahmin, of the gentlemen renunciates who go forth from home to homelessness because of me, I am their leader, I am their helper, I am their advisor; and the populace follows my example.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSir Gotama, it is hard to settle in dwellings in remote wilderness or forest areas, seclusion is hard to practice, solitude is hard to enjoy; the forest seemingly<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote3sym" name="sdfootnote3anc"><sup>3</sup></a> harasses the mind of a monk who does not gain concentration.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSo it is, Brahmin; so it is, Brahmin. Brahmin, it is hard to settle in dwellings in remote wilderness or forest areas, seclusion is hard to practice, solitude is hard to enjoy; the forest seemingly harasses the mind of a monk who does not gain concentration.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúBrahmin, before my awakening, when I was still just an unawakened Bodhisatta<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote4sym" name="sdfootnote4anc"><sup>4</sup></a>, I was aware of this: ‚ÄòIt is hard to settle in dwellings in remote wilderness or forest areas, seclusion is hard to practice, solitude is hard to enjoy; the forest seemingly harasses the mind of a monk who does not gain concentration.‚Äô</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúBrahmin, it occurred to me, ‚ÄòWhen contemplatives or brahmins who are not pure in their physical conduct go to dwell in remote wilderness or forest areas, because of that flaw ‚Äì their impure physical conduct ‚Äì those honorable contemplatives and brahmins bring upon themselves unwholesome fear and terror. But when I go to dwell in remote wilderness or forest areas, I am not impure in my physical conduct; I am pure in my physical conduct. Of the noble ones who are pure in their physical conduct when they go to dwell in remote wilderness or forest areas, I am one of them.‚Äô Brahmin, seeing pure physical conduct in myself, I became more confident about living in the wilderness.</p>

<p align="left">‚ÄúBrahmin, there are some contemplatives and brahmins who perceive the night as exactly the same as the day, and the day as exactly the same as the night. Here I say that those contemplatives and brahmins are dwelling in confusion. However, Brahmin, I perceive the night as exactly the same as the night, and the day as exactly the same as the day. Brahmin, if one might rightly speak of a person as ‚ÄòA being who is characteristically unconfused has arisen in the world for the welfare and happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit and welfare of celestial and human beings,‚Äô they would be rightly speaking of me as ‚ÄòA being who is characteristically unconfused has arisen in the world for the welfare and happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit and welfare of celestial and human beings.‚Äô</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúBrahmin, in me unrelenting energy was initiated, clear mindfulness was established, my body was tranquil and unagitated, my mind was concentrated and focused<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote9sym" name="sdfootnote9anc"><sup>9</sup></a>. Brahmin, isolated from sensuality and from unwholesome phenomena, I attained and remained in the first JhƒÅna, which has thought, examination, and the rapture and happiness produced by isolation. With the pacification<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote10sym" name="sdfootnote10anc"><sup>10</sup></a> of thought and examination, and with internal composure and mental unification, I attained and remained in the second JhƒÅna, which has no thought, no examination, and has the rapture and happiness produced by concentration. With the dissipation of rapture I dwelt equanimous, mindful, and clearly aware ‚Äì what the noble ones describe as ‚ÄòEquanimous, mindful, and happy‚Äô; I attained and remained in the third JhƒÅna. With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous disappearance of elation and depression, I attained and remained in the fourth JhƒÅna, which has neither pain nor pleasure, and has purity of mindfulness and equanimity.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúWhen my mind was concentrated in this way ‚Äì completely pure, completely clean, flawless, free of defilements, flexible, workable, stable, and imperturbable ‚Äì I directed my mind to the recollection of past lives. I remember numerous past lives ‚Äì one life, two lives, three lives‚Ä¶ a hundred lives‚Ä¶ a hundred thousand lives‚Ä¶ many eons of universal expansion‚Ä¶ many eons of universal contraction‚Ä¶ many eons of universal expansion and contraction ‚Äì ‚ÄòAt that place I had this name, this family, this appearance, this food, this experience of pleasure and pain, this death. Falling from there, I appeared over there, where I had that name, that family, that appearance, that food, that experience of pleasure and pain, that death. Falling from there, I appeared here.‚Äô In this way, I remember numerous past lives and their characteristics in detail. Brahmin, this was the knowledge that was attained by me in the first part of the night. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose, darkness was destroyed and light arose ‚Äì as it is for one who is vigilant, persistent, and determined.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúWhen my mind was concentrated in this way ‚Äì completely pure, completely clean, flawless, free of defilements, flexible, workable, stable, and imperturbable ‚Äì I directed my mind to the knowledge of birth and death. With divine vision, which is pure and surpasses human vision, I see beings falling and appearing ‚Äì inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in good places and bad places; I understand how beings fare according to their actions<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote11sym" name="sdfootnote11anc"><sup>11</sup></a>: ‚ÄòThese honorable beings engaged in physical, verbal, and mental misconduct; they disparaged noble beings, they held wrong view, and they based their actions on wrong view. When they were separated from their bodies after death, they appeared in deprivation, a bad destination, downfall ‚Äì hell. However, these honorable beings engaged in good physical, verbal, and mental conduct; they did not disparage noble beings, they held right view, and they based their actions on right view. When they were separated from their bodies after death, they appeared in a good destination ‚Äì a heavenly world.‚Äô In this way, with divine vision, which is pure and surpasses human vision, I see beings falling and appearing ‚Äì inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in good places and bad places; I understand how beings fare according to their actions. Brahmin, this was the knowledge that was attained by me in the middle part of the night. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose, darkness was destroyed and light arose ‚Äì as it is for one who is vigilant, persistent, and determined.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúWhen my mind was concentrated in this way ‚Äì completely pure, completely clean, flawless, free of defilements, flexible, workable, stable, and imperturbable ‚Äì I directed my mind to the knowledge of the elimination of the corruptions. I directly knew as it really is, ‚ÄòThis is suffering,‚Äô ‚ÄòThis is the origin of suffering,‚Äô ‚ÄòThis is the cessation of suffering,‚Äô ‚ÄòThis is the path of practice which leads to the cessation of suffering,‚Äô ‚ÄòThese are the corruptions,‚Äô ‚ÄòThis is the origin of the corruptions,‚Äô ‚ÄòThis is the cessation of the corruptions,‚Äô ‚ÄòThis is the path of practice which leads to the cessation of the corruptions.‚Äô Knowing and seeing in this way, my mind was freed from the corruption of sensuality, the corruption of existence, and the corruption of ignorance. With liberation there was the knowledge ‚ÄòLiberated.‚Äô I directly knew, ‚ÄòBirth is eliminated, the spiritual life has been completed, what was to be done has been done, there will not be another life here.‚Äô Brahmin, this was the knowledge that was attained by me in the third part of the night. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose, darkness was destroyed and light arose ‚Äì as it is for one who is vigilant, persistent, and determined.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúBrahmin, you may think, ‚ÄòApparently even today the contemplative Gotama is still not free of lust, hatred, and delusion, which is why he goes to dwell in remote wilderness or forest areas.‚Äô Brahmin, this is not the way to see it. Brahmin, seeing two benefits, I go to dwell in remote wilderness or forest areas: I see it as a pleasant way of life for myself here and now, and I have compassion for the next generation.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúIndeed, Sir Gotama has compassion for the next generation, as it is for an Arahant, a Rightly Self-Awakened One. Wonderful, Sir Gotama! Wonderful, Sir Gotama! Sir Gotama, just as one might set upright what has been overturned, or reveal what has been concealed, or explain the path to one who is confused, or bring an oil-lamp into the darkness so those with eyes can see ‚Äì in the same way, Sir Gotama has revealed the Dhamma in many ways. I go for refuge to Sir Gotama, and to the Dhamma, and to the monastic community. May Sir Gotama remember me as a disciple who has taken refuge for the rest of his life.‚Äù</p>
