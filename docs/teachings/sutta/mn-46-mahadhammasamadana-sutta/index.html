<p align="left"><span style="font-size: medium;">Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Fortunate One was living at SƒÅvatthi, in Jeta Grove, at AnƒÅthapi·πá·∏çaka‚Äôs Monastery. There the Fortunate One addressed the monks: ‚ÄúMonks!‚Äù ‚ÄúVenerable sir,‚Äù those monks replied to the Fortunate One. The Fortunate One said this:</span></p>
<p align="left">‚Äú<span style="font-size: medium;">Monks, most beings have this desire, this interest, this aspiration: ‚ÄòMay unwanted, undesired, unpleasant things diminish, and may wanted, desired, and pleasant things increase!‚Äô Monks, for those beings who have that desire, interest, and aspiration, unwanted, undesired, unpleasant things increase, and wanted, desired, and pleasant things diminish. Monks, what is the reason for that?‚Äù</span></p>
<p align="left">‚Äú<span style="font-size: medium;">Bhante, for us, the Fortunate One is the root of the Dhamma, the guide, the reference. Bhante, it would be excellent if the Fortunate One would reveal the meaning of this statement. The monks will listen to the Fortunate One and remember.‚Äù</span></p>
<p align="left">‚Äú<span style="font-size: medium;">Therefore, monks, listen and pay attention well. I will speak.‚Äù</span></p>
<p align="left">‚Äú<span style="font-size: medium;">Yes, Bhante,‚Äù those monks replied to the Fortunate One. The Fortunate One said this:</span></p>
<p align="left">‚Äú<span style="font-size: medium;">Monks, here the uneducated commoner ‚Äì one who does not see noble beings, is not familiar with the teachings of noble beings, has not been trained in the teachings of noble beings, who does not see good people, is not familiar with the teachings of good people, and has not been trained in the teachings of good people ‚Äì does not know what things are to be engaged in, what things are not to be engaged in, what things are to be participated in, and what things are not to be participated in. Not knowing what things are to be engaged in, what things are not to be engaged in, what things are to be participated in, and what things are not to be participated in, they engage in the things that are not to be engaged in, do not engage in the things that are to be engaged in, participate in the things that are not to be participated in, and do not participate in the things that are to be participated in. As they engage in the things that are not to be engaged in, do not engage in the things that are to be engaged in, participate in the things that are not to be participated in, and do not participate in the things that are to be participated in, unwanted, undesired, unpleasant things increase, and wanted, desired, and pleasant things diminish. For what reason? Monks, this is how it is for one who lacks wisdom.</span></p>
<p align="left">‚Äú<span style="font-size: medium;">Monks, here the educated student of noble beings ‚Äì one who sees noble beings, is familiar with the teachings of noble beings, has been well-trained in the teachings of noble beings, who sees good people, is familiar with the teachings of good people, and has been well-trained in the teachings of good people ‚Äì knows what things are to be engaged in, what things are not to be engaged in, what things are to be participated in, and what things are not to be participated in.

<p align="left">‚Äú<span style="font-size: medium;">Monks, it is just as if there was a bitter drink mixed with poison.
