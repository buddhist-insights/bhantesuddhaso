<p align="left">Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at SƒÅvatthi, in Jeta&#8217;s Grove, at AnƒÅthapi·πá·∏çika&#8217;s Park. There the Blessed One addressed the monks: ‚ÄúMonks!‚Äù ‚ÄúAuspicious sir,‚Äù those monks replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this: ‚ÄúMonks, I will teach an analysis of non-conflict<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote1sym" name="sdfootnote1anc"><sup>1</sup></a> for you. Listen to this and carefully pay attention; I will speak.‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, Bhante,‚Äù those monks replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúOne should not be committed to sensual pleasure, which is inferior, [the behavior] of villagers<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote2sym" name="sdfootnote2anc"><sup>2</sup></a>, [the behavior] of commoners<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote3sym" name="sdfootnote3anc"><sup>3</sup></a>, ignoble, and unbeneficial. One should also not be committed to self-torment, which is painful, ignoble, and unbeneficial. Monks, without approaching either of these two extremes, a moderate path of practice<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote4sym" name="sdfootnote4anc"><sup>4</sup></a> has been awakened to by the TathƒÅgata, which produces vision, produces knowledge, and leads to tranquility, higher knowledge, awakening, and NibbƒÅna. One should understand flattery and one should understand disparagement. Having understood flattery and disparagement, one should neither flatter nor disparage; one should just teach the Dhamma. One should understand the definition of happiness. Having understood the definition of happiness, one should be committed to internal happiness. One is not to gossip<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote5sym" name="sdfootnote5anc"><sup>5</sup></a>, and one is not to make critical remarks about a person who is present. One is to speak unhurriedly, not hurriedly. One is not to insist on using the language of a [particular] country, and one is not to override conventional [terminology]. This is the table of contents for the analysis of non-conflict.</p>
<p align="left">[<i>Sensual </i><i>P</i><i>leasure and </i><i>S</i><i>elf-torment</i>]</p>
<p align="left">‚Äú&#8217;One should not be committed to sensual pleasure, which is inferior, [the behavior] of villagers, [the behavior] of commoners, ignoble, and unbeneficial. One should also not be committed to self-torment, which is painful, ignoble, and unbeneficial.&#8217; This is what was said; what does this refer to?</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúDevotion to the elation that arises from pleasure that is connected with sensuality, which is inferior, [the behavior] of villagers, [the behavior] of commoners, ignoble, and unbeneficial ‚Äì this phenomenon brings suffering, infliction, anguish, and fever; it is the wrong practice.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúNon-devotion to the elation that arises from pleasure that is connected with sensuality, which is inferior, [the behavior] of villagers, [the behavior] of commoners, ignoble, and unbeneficial ‚Äì this phenomenon is free of suffering, free of infliction, free of anguish, free of fever; it is the right practice.</p>

<p align="left">‚Äú&#8217;One should understand the definition of happiness. Having understood the definition of happiness, one should be committed to internal happiness.&#8217; This is what was said; what does this refer to?</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúMonks, there are these five cords of sensuality. What five? Visible objects cognizable by the eye which are desirable, appealing, pleasing, enjoyable, sensual, and exciting. Sounds cognizable by the ear‚Ä¶ fragrances cognizable by the nose‚Ä¶ flavors cognizable by the tongue‚Ä¶ tangible objects cognizable by the body which are desirable, appealing, pleasing, enjoyable, sensual, and exciting. Monks, these are the five cords of sensuality. Monks, any pleasure and elation that arises dependent on these five cords of sensuality is called sensual pleasure, dirty<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote6sym" name="sdfootnote6anc"><sup>6</sup></a> pleasure, vulgar pleasure, ignoble pleasure. I say that such pleasure is not to be cultivated, not to be developed, not to be made much of; such pleasure is to be regarded as dangerous.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúMonks, here a monk who is secluded from sensuality and secluded from unwholesome phenomena attains and remains in the first <i>jhƒÅna</i>, which has thought, has consideration, and has rapture and happiness produced by seclusion. With the tranquilizing of thought and consideration, he attains and remains in the second <i>jhƒÅna</i>, which has internal composure, mental unification, is free of thought, is free of consideration, and has rapture and happiness produced by concentration. With the dissipation of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, and clearly aware, experiencing pleasure with the body; what the noble ones describe as &#8216;Equanimous, mindful, and dwelling happily&#8217; ‚Äì he attains and remains in the third <i>jhƒÅna</i>. With the abandoning of pleasure, the abandoning of pain, and the previous disappearance of elation and dejection, he attains and remains in the fourth <i>jhƒÅna</i>, which has neither pain nor pleasure, and has purity of mindfulness and equanimity. This is called the pleasure of renunciation, the pleasure of seclusion, the pleasure of tranquility, the pleasure of awakening. I say that such pleasure is to be cultivated, is to be developed, is to be made much of; such pleasure is not to be regarded as dangerous.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote7sym" name="sdfootnote7anc"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
