<p align="left">Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at SƒÅvatthi, at Jeta‚Äôs Grove, in AnƒÅthapi·πá·∏çika‚Äôs Park. On that occasion there was a monk named Ari·π≠·π≠ha, who had previously been a vulture-trapper, and in whom a harmful opinion had arisen to this effect: ‚ÄúAs I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those things which are spoken of by the Blessed One as obstructive are not obstructive for one who indulges in them.‚Äù Many monks heard, ‚ÄúApparently there is a monk named Ari·π≠·π≠ha, who was previously a vulture-trapper, and in whom a harmful opinion has arisen to this effect: ‚ÄòAs I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those things which are spoken of by the Blessed One as obstructive are not obstructive for one who indulges in them.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">Then those monks approached Venerable Ari·π≠·π≠ha and said to him, ‚ÄúVenerable Ari·π≠·π≠ha, is it true that a harmful opinion that arisen in you to this effect: ‚ÄòAs I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those things which are spoken of by the Blessed One as obstructive are not obstructive for one who indulges in them‚Äô?‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúYes, Venerables. As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those things which are spoken of by the Blessed One as obstructive are not obstructive for one who indulges in them.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">Then those monks, wishing to separate the monk Ari·π≠·π≠ha from that harmful opinion, enjoined, pressured, and entreated him: ‚ÄúVenerable Ari·π≠·π≠ha, do not speak in that way, do not slander the Blessed One; it is not good to slander the Blessed One, it is not good to speak about the Blessed One in that way. Venerable Ari·π≠·π≠ha, in many ways obstructive things have been spoken about by the Blessed One as obstructive. They are obstructive for one who indulges in them. Sensuality has been spoken about by the Blessed One as bringing little gratification, much suffering, and much anguish; the drawback here is greater [than the gratification]. Sensuality has been spoken about by the Blessed One using the simile of the skeleton‚Ä¶ the simile of the piece of meat‚Ä¶ the simile of the charcoal pit‚Ä¶ the simile of the dream‚Ä¶ the simile of the borrower‚Ä¶ the simile of the tree-fruit‚Ä¶ the simile of the chopping-block‚Ä¶ the simile of the spear‚Ä¶ the simile of the serpent‚Äôs head. It brings much suffering and much anguish; the drawback here is greater [than the gratification].‚Äù But although the monk Ari·π≠·π≠ha was enjoined, pressured, and entreated in this way by those monks, he still stubbornly held on to and professed that harmful opinion: ‚ÄúAs I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those things which are spoken of by the Blessed One as obstructive are not obstructive for one who indulges in them.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">When those monks were not able to separate the monk Ari·π≠·π≠ha from that harmful opinion, they approached the Blessed One, paid respects to him, and sat to one side. While they were seated to one side, those monks said to the Blessed One, ‚ÄúBhante, a harmful opinion has arisen in the monk named Ari·π≠·π≠ha to this effect: ‚ÄòAs I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those things which are spoken of by the Blessed One as obstructive are not obstructive for one who indulges in them.‚Äô Bhante, we heard that ‚ÄòA harmful opinion has arisen in the monk named Ari·π≠·π≠ha&#8230;‚Äô Then, Bhante, we went to the monk Ari·π≠·π≠ha and said to him, ‚ÄòVenerable Ari·π≠·π≠ha, is it true‚Ä¶?‚Äô Then, Bhante, we enjoined, pressured, and entreated him in this way‚Ä¶ Bhante, when we were not able to separate the monk Ari·π≠·π≠ha from that harmful opinion, we reported this matter to the Blessed One.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">Then the Blessed One said to a certain monk, ‚ÄúGo, monk, and summon the monk Ari·π≠·π≠ha using my words: ‚ÄòVenerable Ari·π≠·π≠ha, the Teacher summons you.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúYes, Bhante,‚Äù that monk replied to the Blessed One. He went to the monk Ari·π≠·π≠ha and said to him, ‚ÄúVenerable Ari·π≠·π≠ha, the Teacher summons you.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúYes, Venerable,‚Äù the monk Ari·π≠·π≠ha replied to that monk. He approached the Blessed One, paid respects, and sat to one side.</p>
<p align="left">When the monk Ari·π≠·π≠ha was seated to one side, the Blessed One said to him, ‚ÄúAri·π≠·π≠ha, is it true that a harmful opinion has arisen in you to this effect: ‚ÄòAs I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those things which are spoken of by the Blessed One as obstructive are not obstructive for one who indulges in them‚Äô?‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúYes, Bhante. As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those things which are spoken of by the Blessed One as obstructive are not obstructive for one who indulges in them.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúYou foolish man, how could you understand in that way the Dhamma taught by me? Foolish man, isn‚Äôt it true that in many ways obstructive things have been spoken about by me as obstructive? They are obstructive for one who indulges in them. Sensuality has been spoken about by me as bringing little gratification, much suffering, and much anguish; the drawback here is greater [than the gratification]. Sensuality has been spoken about by the Blessed One using the simile of the skeleton‚Ä¶ the simile of the piece of meat‚Ä¶ the simile of the charcoal pit‚Ä¶ the simile of the dream‚Ä¶ the simile of the borrower‚Ä¶ the simile of the tree-fruit‚Ä¶ the simile of the chopping-block‚Ä¶ the simile of the spear‚Ä¶ the simile of the serpent‚Äôs head.

You ruin yourself and accumulate much demerit. Foolish man, this will be for your long-term detriment and suffering.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">Then the Blessed One addressed the monks, ‚ÄúWhat do you think, monks? Has this monk Ari·π≠·π≠ha produced even a spark [of wisdom] in this Dhamma-Vinaya?‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúHow could that be, Bhante? Certainly not, Bhante.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">When this was said, the monk Ari·π≠·π≠ha become silent and ashamed, and he sat with shoulders slumped and face downcast, sulky and unresponsive. Knowing that the monk Ari·π≠·π≠ha was silent and ashamed, sitting with his shoulders slumped and face downcast, sulky and unresponsive, the Blessed One said to him, ‚ÄúFoolish man, you will be known by your own harmful opinion. I will question the monks about this.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">Then the Blessed One addressed the monks: ‚ÄúMonks, do you understand the Dhamma taught by me in the same way that the monk Ari·π≠·π≠ha does, when he slanders me with his bad grasp [of the teaching], ruining himself and accumulate much demerit?‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúCertainly not, Bhante. Bhante, in many ways obstructive things have been spoken about by the Blessed One as obstructive‚Ä¶ the drawback here is greater [than the gratification].‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúGood, good, monks. Monks, it is good that you understand in this way the Dhamma taught by me. Monks, in many ways obstructive things have been spoken about by me as obstructive&#8230; the drawback here is greater [than the gratification]. Then this monk Ari·π≠·π≠ha slanders me with his bad grasp [of the teaching], ruining himself and accumulating much demerit. That will be for this foolish man‚Äôs long-term detriment and suffering.

Perhaps I will gather grass and wood and branches and leaves, bind them together into a raft, and then, relying on that raft, I will make an effort with my arms and legs to cross safely to the other side.‚Äô</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúThen, monks, that person gathered grass and wood and branches and leaves, bound them together into a raft, and then, relying on that raft, he made an effort with his arms and legs to cross safely to the other side.

<p align="left">‚ÄúIn the same way, monks, I have taught you how the Dhamma is like a raft; it is for the purpose of escaping, not for the the purpose of grasping.

<p align="left">‚ÄúHow could it not be, Bhante? Bhante, it is utterly and completely foolish.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúWhat do you think, monks? Is the body permanent or impermanent?‚Äù</p>

<p align="left">‚ÄúTherefore, monks, any body ‚Äì past, future, or present, internal or external, obvious or subtle, inferior or excellent, far or near ‚Äì all should be accurately seen with correct wisdom in this way: ‚ÄòThis is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.‚Äô Any feeling&#8230; recognition‚Ä¶ mental formations‚Ä¶ consciousness ‚Äì past, future, or present, internal or external, obvious or subtle, inferior or excellent, far or near ‚Äì all should be accurately seen with correct wisdom in this way: ‚ÄòThis is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.‚Äô</p>
