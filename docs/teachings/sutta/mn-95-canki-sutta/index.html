<p align="left">Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was traveling among the Kosalans together with a large group of monks when he came to OpƒÅsƒÅda, a Kosalan village of brahmins. There the Blessed One lived north of OpƒÅsƒÅda, in Angel‚Äôs Grove, a grove of sal trees.</p>
<p align="left">At that time the brahmin Ca·πÖki was living in OpƒÅsƒÅda, a place filled with living beings, grass, lumber, water, and grain that had been given to him as a royal endowment of divine quality from King Pasenadi of Kosala.</p>
<p align="left">The brahmin householders of OpƒÅsƒÅda heard, ‚ÄúIt seems the contemplative Gotama, son of a Sakyan, a renunciant from the Sakya clan, is traveling among the Kosalans together with a large group of monks, and has arrived at OpƒÅsƒÅda and is living north of OpƒÅsƒÅda in Angel‚Äôs Grove, a grove of sal trees. This good report has come up about the honorable Gotama: ‚ÄòHe is a Blessed One, a Worthy One, a Rightly Self-Awakened One; he has perfect knowledge and conduct; he is a Sublime One, a World-Knower, an unsurpassed trainer of tamable people, a teacher of angels and humans, an Awakened One, a Blessed One.‚Äô Having personally attained higher knowledge of it by himself, he explains this world, with its angels, demons, divinities, its generation of contemplatives and priests, celestial and human beings. He teaches a Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in its conclusion, with the right meaning and phrasing; he reveals a spiritual life that is completely perfect and pure. It is good to see such worthy beings.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">Then groups of brahmin householders left OpƒÅsƒÅda through its northern entrance and went towards Angel‚Äôs Grove, the grove of sal trees. On this occasion, the brahmin Ca·πÖki had gone to the daybed at the top of his mansion. He saw that groups of brahmin householders had left OpƒÅsƒÅda through its northern entrance and were going to Angel‚Äôs Grove, to the grove of sal trees. Having seen this, he said to Khatta, ‚ÄúSir Khatta, why have groups of brahmin householders left OpƒÅsƒÅda through its northern entrance and are going towards Angel‚Äôs Grove, the grove of sal trees?‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSir Ca·πÖki, the contemplative Gotama‚Ä¶ has arrived‚Ä¶ This good report has come up‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòHe is a Blessed One&#8230;‚Äô They go to see the honorable Gotama.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúTherefore, sir Khatta, approach the brahmin householders from OpƒÅsƒÅda and say to them, ‚ÄòSirs, the brahmin Ca·πÖki says, ‚ÄúPlease wait, the brahmin Ca·πÖki also wishes to go and see the contemplative Gotama.‚Äù‚Äô‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù Khatta replied to the brahmin Ca·πÖki. He approached the brahmin householders from OpƒÅsƒÅda and said to them, ‚ÄúSirs, the brahmin Ca·πÖki says, ‚ÄòPlease wait, the brahmin Ca·πÖki also wishes to go and see the contemplative Gotama.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">At that time there were five hundred brahmins from several other countries visiting OpƒÅsƒÅda on some errand. Those brahmins heard, ‚ÄúApparently the brahmin Ca·πÖki will go to see the contemplative Gotama.‚Äù Then those brahmins went to the brahmin Ca·πÖki and said to him, ‚ÄúSir Ca·πÖki, is it true that you will go to see the contemplative Gotama?‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúIt is true, sirs, that I am thinking, ‚ÄòI will go to see the contemplative Gotama.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSir Ca·πÖki, don‚Äôt go to see the contemplative Gotama! It is not proper for Sir Ca·πÖki to go to see the contemplative Gotama; it is proper for the contemplative Gotama to come to see Sir Ca·πÖki.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSir Ca·πÖki has a pure family lineage through both maternal and paternal lines as far back as the seventh ancestor; he is flawless and irreproachable when speaking of birth. For this reason, it is not proper for Sir Ca·πÖki to go to see the contemplative Gotama; it is proper for the contemplative Gotama to come to see Sir Ca·πÖki.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSir Ca·πÖki is wealthy, very wealthy, extremely wealthy‚Ä¶.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSir Ca·πÖki is a master of the Three Vedas, including all five of its divisions; he knows words and phrases, he knows philosophy, he knows all the characteristics of great people‚Ä¶</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSir Ca·πÖki is handsome, good-looking, delightful, as beautiful as a magnificent flower, divinely beautiful, divinely splendid, such as is rarely seen&#8230;</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSir Ca·πÖki is virtuous, he has an elder‚Äôs virtue, he has attained an elder‚Äôs virtue‚Ä¶</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSir Ca·πÖki has moral speech, moral conversation, humane speech; he is eloquent, articulate, communicative‚Ä¶</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSir Ca·πÖki is the teacher of many teachers, and he teaches mantras to three hundred students‚Ä¶</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSir Ca·πÖki is honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by King Pasenadi of Kosala‚Ä¶</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSir Ca·πÖki is honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by the brahmin PokkharasƒÅti‚Ä¶</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSir Ca·πÖki lives in OpƒÅsƒÅda, a place filled with living beings, grass, lumber, water, and grain that had been given to him as a royal endowment of divine quality from King Pasenadi of Kosala. For this reason, it is not proper for Sir Ca·πÖki to go to see the contemplative Gotama; it is proper for the contemplative Gotama to come to see Sir Ca·πÖki.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">When this was said, the brahmin Ca·πÖki said to those brahmins, ‚ÄúNow, sirs, listen to me, as to why it is proper for me to go to see the contemplative Gotama, and why it is not proper for Sir Gotama to come to see me.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúThe contemplative Gotama has a pure family lineage through both maternal and paternal lines as far back as the seventh ancestor; he is flawless and irreproachable when speaking of birth‚Ä¶</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúThe contemplative Gotama left behind abundant gold and silver, and became a renunciant, living on the earth in the open air‚Ä¶</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúThe contemplative Gotama left the household life and become a homeless renunciant while he was still young, youthful, dark-haired, blessed with youthfulness, in the first stage of his life‚Ä¶</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúThe contemplative Gotama cut off his hair and beard, put on brown robes, and left the household life to become a homeless renunciant, even though his mother and father did not want it and wept with tearful faces‚Ä¶</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúThe contemplative Gotama is handsome, good-looking, delightful, as beautiful as a magnificent flower, divinely beautiful, divinely splendid, such as is rarely seen‚Ä¶</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúThe contemplative Gotama is virtuous, he has a noble being‚Äôs virtue, he has wholesome virtue, he has attained wholesome virtue&#8230;</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúThe contemplative Gotama has moral speech, moral conversation, humane speech; he is eloquent, articulate, communicative‚Ä¶</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúThe contemplative Gotama is the teacher of many teachers‚Ä¶</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúThe contemplative Gotama has eliminated all sensual lust and fickleness‚Ä¶</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúThe contemplative Gotama is a proponent of karma, of the efficacy of action; his priority is not to harm the population of brahmins‚Ä¶</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúThe contemplative Gotama is a renunciant from a lofty family, an unbroken aristocrat family‚Ä¶</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúThe contemplative Gotama is a renunciant from a wealthy family, very wealthy, extremely wealthy‚Ä¶</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúPeople come from distant kingdoms and distant countries to ask questions of the contemplative Gotama‚Ä¶</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSeveral thousand angels have gone to the Buddha for life-long refuge‚Ä¶</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúThis good report has come up about the contemplative Gotama: ‚ÄòHe is a Blessed One, a Worthy One, a Rightly Self-Awakened One; he has perfect knowledge and conduct; he is a Sublime One, a World-Knower, an unsurpassed trainer of tamable people, a teacher of angels and humans, an Awakened One, a Blessed One&#8230;‚Äô</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúThe contemplative Gotama has the thirty-two characteristics of a great person‚Ä¶</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúKing Seniya BimbisƒÅra of Magadha, as well as his sons and daughters, have gone to the contemplative Gotama for life-long refuge‚Ä¶</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúKing Pasenadi of Kosala, as well as his sons and daughters, have gone to the contemplative Gotama for life-long refuge‚Ä¶</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúThe brahmin PokkharasƒÅti, as well as his sons and daughters, have gone to the contemplative Gotama for life-long refuge‚Ä¶</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúThe contemplative Gotama has arrived at OpƒÅsƒÅda, and is living north of OpƒÅsƒÅda in Angel‚Äôs Grove, a grove of sal trees. Contemplatives and brahmins who come to our villages and fields are our guests. Guests are to be honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by us. Since the contemplative Gotama has arrived at OpƒÅsƒÅda, and is living north of OpƒÅsƒÅda in Angel‚Äôs Grove, a grove of sal trees, the contemplative Gotama is our guest. A guest is to be honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by us. This is why it is proper for me to go to see Sir Gotama, and why it is not proper for Sir Gotama to come to see me.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSirs, although I am able to praise Sir Gotama to this extent, this is not the limit of Sir Gotama‚Äôs praiseworthiness; Sir Gotama‚Äôs praiseworthiness is unlimited. Even if he had just one of these traits it would not be proper for Sir Gotama to come to see me, and it would be proper for me to go to see Sir Gotama. Therefore, sirs, now we will all go to see the contemplative Gotama.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">Then the brahmin Ca·πÖki approached the Blessed One together with a large group of brahmins and conversed with him. After the appropriate polite conversation was finished, he sat to one side.</p>
<p align="left">On this occasion the Blessed One was seated there after having engaged in some polite speech with several elderly brahmins. There was also a young sixteen-year-old student with a shaven head named KƒÅpa·π≠ika seated in the assembly ‚Äì he was a master of the Three Vedas, including all five of its divisions; he knew words and phrases, philosophy, and all the characteristics of great people. He interrupted the conversation that the elderly brahmins were having with the Blessed One.</p>
<p align="left">Then the Blessed One rebuked the student KƒÅpa·π≠ika: ‚ÄúVenerable BhƒÅradvƒÅja should not interrupt the elderly brahmins‚Äô conversation. He should wait until the conversation is finished.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">When this was said, the brahmin Ca·πÖki said to the Blessed One, ‚ÄúSir Gotama should not rebuke the student KƒÅpa·π≠ika. The student KƒÅpa·π≠ika is a gentleman, very learned, wise, and a good speaker; he is able to participate in this discussion with the Blessed One.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">Then the Blessed One thought, ‚ÄúMost likely the student KƒÅpa·π≠ika‚Äôs statements will be about the brahmin scriptures of the Three Sciences. This is why the brahmins respect him.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">Then the student KƒÅpa·π≠ika thought, ‚ÄúWhen the contemplative Gotama looks at my eyes, I will ask him a question.‚Äù The Blessed One read the student KƒÅpa·π≠ika‚Äôs mind, and looked at his eyes.</p>
<p align="left">Then the student KƒÅpa·π≠ika thought, ‚ÄúThe contemplative Gotama is paying attention to me. Perhaps I will ask him a question.‚Äù Then he said to the Blessed One, ‚ÄúSir Gotama, regarding the mantras, aphorisms, and scriptures of the ancient brahmins, contemporary brahmins arrive at the definite conclusion, ‚ÄòOnly this is true, everything else is false.‚Äô What does Sir Gotama say about this?‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúBhƒÅradvƒÅja, is there even one brahmin among all brahmins who says, ‚ÄòI know this, I see this. Only this is true, everything else is false‚Äô?‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúCertainly not, sir Gotama.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúBhƒÅradvƒÅja, is there even a single teacher of the brahmins, or a teacher‚Äôs teacher, as far back as seven generations of teachers, who says, ‚ÄòI know this, I see this. Only this is true, everything else is false‚Äô?‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúCertainly not, Sir Gotama.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúBhƒÅradvƒÅja, the brahmins of the past who invented and taught the mantras which were sung, recited, and collected of old, and which are now still sung, spoken, repeated, and taught ‚Äì namely, A·π≠·π≠haka, VƒÅmaka, VƒÅmadeva, VessƒÅmitta, Yamataggi, A·πÖgƒ´rasa, BhƒÅradvƒÅja, VƒÅse·π≠·π≠ha, Kassapa, and Bhagu ‚Äì did they say, ‚ÄòI know this, I see this. Only this is true, everything else is false‚Äô?‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúCertainly not, Sir Gotama.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSo, BhƒÅradvƒÅja, it seems that there is not even one brahmin among all brahmins who says ‚ÄòI know this, I see this. Only this is true, everything else is false‚Äô; there is not even a single teacher of the brahmins, or a teacher‚Äôs teacher, as far as back as seven generations of teachers, who says, ‚ÄòI know this, I see this. Only this is true, everything else is false‚Äô; and not even the brahmins of the past who invented and taught the mantras which were sung, recited, and collected of old, and which are now still sung, spoken, repeated, and taught ‚Äì namely, A·π≠·π≠haka, VƒÅmaka, VƒÅmadeva, VessƒÅmitta, Yamataggi, A·πÖgƒ´rasa, BhƒÅradvƒÅja, VƒÅse·π≠·π≠ha, Kassapa, and Bhagu ‚Äì said ‚ÄòI know this, I see this. Only this is true, everything else is false.‚Äô</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúBhƒÅradvƒÅja, it is like a line of blind people, each one holding the next; the first one does not see, the middle one does not see, the last one does not see. In the same way, BhƒÅradvƒÅja, it seems to me that the statements of the brahmins are like a line of blind people ‚Äì the first one does not see, the middle one does not see, and the last one does not see. What do you think, BhƒÅradvƒÅja ‚Äì since this is so, isn‚Äôt the faith of the brahmins baseless?‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSir Gotama, the brahmins here do not rely only on faith. They also rely on oral tradition.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúBhƒÅradvƒÅja, previously you went on faith, now you claim oral tradition. BhƒÅradvƒÅja, there are five things which can have two different results here and now. What five? Faith, preference, oral tradition, logical thought, and approval of a viewpoint based on contemplation ‚Äì BhƒÅradvƒÅja, these are five things which can have two different results here and now.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúBhƒÅradvƒÅja, one may have strong faith in something, and yet it turns out to be meaningless, hollow, wrong; or one may not have strong faith in something, yet it turns out to be accurate, precise, and unerring.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúBhƒÅradvƒÅja, one may have a strong preference for something, and yet it turns out to be meaningless, hollow, wrong; or one may not have a strong preference for something, yet it turns out to be accurate, precise, and unerring.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúBhƒÅradvƒÅja, one may have received a strong oral tradition about something, and yet it turns out to be meaningless, hollow, wrong; or one may not have received a strong oral tradition about something, yet it turns out to be accurate, precise, and unerring.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúBhƒÅradvƒÅja, one may have a strong basis of logical thought about something, and yet it turns out to be meaningless, hollow, wrong; or one may not have a strong basis of logical thought about something, yet it turns out to be accurate, precise, and unerring.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúBhƒÅradvƒÅja, one may have strong approval of something based on contemplation, and yet it turns out to be meaningless, hollow, false; or one may not have strong approval of something based on contemplation, yet it turns out to be accurate, precise, and unerring.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúBhƒÅradvƒÅja, for a sensible person who is a protector of truth, these are not sufficient reasons to arrive at a definite conclusion that ‚ÄòOnly this is true, everything else is false.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSir Gotama, how is one a protector of truth, how does one protect truth? We ask Sir Gotama about protecting truth.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúBhƒÅradvƒÅja, if it is a person‚Äôs faith, then if they say ‚ÄòThis is my faith,‚Äô then that statement protects truth; but it is not a sufficient reason to say ‚ÄòOnly this is true, everything else is false.‚Äô</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúBhƒÅradvƒÅja, if it is a person‚Äôs preference, then if they say ‚ÄòThis is my preference,‚Äô then that statement protects truth; but it is not a sufficient reason to say ‚ÄòOnly this is true, everything else is false.‚Äô</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúBhƒÅradvƒÅja, if it is a person‚Äôs oral tradition, then if they say ‚ÄòThis is my oral tradition,‚Äô then that statement protects truth; but it is not a sufficient reason to say ‚ÄòOnly this is true, everything else is false.‚Äô</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúBhƒÅradvƒÅja, if it is a person‚Äôs logical thought, then if they say ‚ÄòThis is my logical thought,‚Äô then that statement protects truth; but it is not a sufficient reason to say ‚ÄòOnly this is true, everything else is false.‚Äô</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúBhƒÅradvƒÅja, if it is a person‚Äôs approval based on contemplation, then if they say ‚ÄòThis is my approval based on contemplation,‚Äô then that statement protects truth; but it is not a sufficient reason to say ‚ÄòOnly this is true, everything else is false.‚Äô</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúBhƒÅradvƒÅja, in this way there is protecting truth, in this way one protects truth, in this way we indicate protecting truth. However, this is not yet awakening to truth.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSir Gotama, in this way there is protecting truth, in this way one protects truth, in this way we see protecting truth. Sir Gotama, how is there awakening to truth, how does one awaken to truth? We ask Sir Gotama about awakening to truth.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúHere, BhƒÅradvƒÅja, a monk lives dependent upon a particular village or town. A householder or his child approaches him and examines him to see if he has three kinds of mindstates ‚Äì mindstates based on greed, mindstates based on aversion, and mindstates based on delusion.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúThey look to see if that venerable‚Äôs mind is overcome by mindstates based on greed, such that when not knowing he says ‚ÄòI know,‚Äô when not seeing he says ‚ÄòI see,‚Äô and he encourages others to do things that lead to their long-term detriment and unhappiness. When examining him in this way, they know, ‚ÄòThis venerable‚Äôs mind is not overcome by mindstates based on greed, such that when not knowing he would say ‚ÄúI know,‚Äù when not seeing he would say ‚ÄúI see,‚Äù or that he would encourage others to do things that lead to their long-term detriment and unhappiness. This venerable‚Äôs physical conduct and verbal conduct are that of a person who is free of greed. The Dhamma that this venerable teaches is profound, hard to see, hard to awaken to, peaceful, sublime, outside the domain of thought, subtle, to be experienced by the wise; this Dhamma is not easy for a greedy person to teach.‚Äô</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúWhen examining him, they see that he is pure of mindstates based on greed; next they examine him to see if he has mindstates based on aversion. They look to see if that venerable‚Äôs mind is overcome by mindstates based on aversion&#8230; When examining him in this way, they know, ‚ÄòThis venerable‚Äôs mind is not overcome by mindstates based on aversion&#8230; The Dhamma that this venerable teaches‚Ä¶ is not easy for an aversive person to teach.‚Äô</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúWhen examining him, they see that he is pure of mindstates based on aversion; next they examine him to see if he has mindstates based on delusion&#8230; When examining him in this way, they know, ‚ÄòThis venerable‚Äôs mind is not overcome by mindstates based on delusion‚Ä¶ The Dhamma that this venerable teaches‚Ä¶ is not easy for a delusional person to teach.‚Äô</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúWhen examining him, they see that he is pure of mindstates based on delusion. Their faith in him becomes settled. Faithful, they approach him; approaching him, they attend to him; attending to him, they listen to him; listening to him, they hear the Dhamma; hearing the Dhamma, they remember it; remembering the Dhamma, they investigate its meaning; investigating the meaning of the Dhamma, they gain approval of the Dhamma based on contemplation; where there is approval of that Dhamma based on contemplation, then they get interested; interested, they try it; having tried it, they evaluate it; having evaluated it, they commit to it; being self-committed, they personally realize the highest truth, for they have made a breakthrough and see it with wisdom.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúBhƒÅradvƒÅja, in this way there is awakening to truth, in this way one awakens to truth, in this way we indicate awakening to truth. However, this is not yet attainment of truth.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSir Gotama, in this way there is awakening to truth, in this way one awakens to truth, in this way we see awakening to truth. Sir Gotama, how is there attainment of truth, how does one attain truth? We ask Sir Gotama about attainment of truth.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúBhƒÅradvƒÅja, when one practices, develops, and makes much of that Dhamma, then there is attainment of truth. BhƒÅradvƒÅja, in this way there is attainment of truth, in this way one attains truth, in this way we indicate attainment of truth.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSir Gotama, in this way there is attainment of truth, in this way one attains truth, in this way we see attainment of truth. Sir Gotama, what is helpful for the attainment of truth? We ask Sir Gotama about what is helpful for the attainment of truth.‚Äù</p>
