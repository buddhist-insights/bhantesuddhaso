<p align="left">Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at SƒÅvatthi, in Jeta&#8217;s Grove, at AnƒÅthapi·πá·∏çika&#8217;s Park. There Venerable SƒÅriputta addressed the monks: ‚ÄúVenerable monks!‚Äù ‚ÄúVenerable sir,‚Äù those monks replied to Venerable SƒÅriputta. Venerable SƒÅriputta said this:</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúVenerables, there are four kinds of people that can be found in the world. What four? Here, Venerables, some person who has a flaw does not understand as it really is:<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote1sym" name="sdfootnote1anc"><sup>1</sup></a> &#8216;I have an internal flaw.&#8217; Here, Venerables, some person who has a flaw understands as it really is: &#8216;I have an internal flaw.&#8217; Here, Venerables, some person who is flawless does not understand as it really is: &#8216;I do not have an internal flaw.&#8217; Here, Venerables, some person who is flawless understands as it really is: &#8216;I do not have an internal flaw.&#8217; There, Venerables, regarding the person who has a flaw and does not understand as it really is &#8216;I have an internal flaw&#8217;: of the two people who have flaws, this one is declared the inferior person. There, Venerables, regarding the person who has a flaw and understands as it really is &#8216;I have an internal flaw&#8217;: of the two people who have flaws, this one is declared the best person. There, Venerables, regarding the flawless person who does not understand as it really is &#8216;I do not have an internal flaw&#8217;: of the two people who are flawless, this one is declared the inferior person. There, Venerables, regarding the flawless person who understands as it really is &#8216;I do not have an internal flaw&#8217;: of the two people who are flawless, this one is declared the best person.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">When this was said, Venerable MahƒÅ-MoggallƒÅna said to Venerable SƒÅriputta, ‚ÄúWhat is the cause, Venerable SƒÅriputta, what is the condition on account of which, of these two people who have flaws, one is declared the inferior person, and one is declared the best person? And, Venerable SƒÅriputta, what is the cause, what is the condition because of which, of these two people who are flawless, one is declared the inferior person, and one is declared the best person?‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúThere, Venerable, this is expected of the person who has a flaw and does not understand as it really is &#8216;I have an internal flaw&#8217;: he will not produce interest,<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote2sym" name="sdfootnote2anc"><sup>2</sup></a> make an effort, and initiate energy for the abandoning of that flaw; he will die while he has lust, anger, delusion, flaws, and a defiled mind. Venerable, it is just like when a bronze dish is brought from a market or a metalsmith which is covered with dirt and stains. The owner of that dish neither uses it nor cleans it, and sets it down in a dirty place.
