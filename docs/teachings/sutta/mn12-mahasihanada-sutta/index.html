<p align="left">Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at VesƒÅli, in a grove to the west of the town of Bahi. On this occasion, the Licchavi Sunakkhatta had recently left this Dhamma-Vinaya<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote1sym" name="sdfootnote1anc"><sup>1</sup></a>. All around VesƒÅli he was saying, ‚ÄúThe contemplative Gotama does not have any superhuman states, nor has he attained any distinction in knowledge and vision that would make him noble. The contemplative Gotama teaches a Dhamma that is the result of thinking, accompanied by investigation, produced by his own eloquence<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote2sym" name="sdfootnote2anc"><sup>2</sup></a>. However, when that teaching is taught to anyone, it does lead one who practices it to the correct elimination of suffering.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">Then in the morning Venerable SƒÅriputta dressed, took his bowl and robe, and entered VesƒÅli for alms. He heard of the Licchavi Sunakkhatta saying all around VesƒÅli, ‚ÄúThe contemplative Gotama does not have any superhuman states‚Ä¶ However, when that teaching is taught to anyone, it does lead one who practices it to the correct elimination of suffering.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">When Venerable SƒÅriputta had gone for alms in SƒÅvatthi, finished his meal, and returned from almsround, he approached the Blessed One, paid respects to him, and sat to one side. When he was seated to one side, Venerable SƒÅriputta said to the Blessed One, ‚ÄúBhante, the Licchavi Sunakkhatta has recently left this Dhamma-Vinaya. All around VesƒÅli he is saying, ‚ÄòThe contemplative Gotama‚Ä¶ the correct elimination of suffering.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSƒÅriputta, Sunakkhatta is an angry, foolish man. This statement he has spoken is the result of anger. SƒÅriputta, thinking ‚ÄòI will speak criticism<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote3sym" name="sdfootnote3anc"><sup>3</sup></a>,‚Äô this foolish man Sunakkhatta only speaks praise of the TathƒÅgata. SƒÅriputta, it is praise of the TathƒÅgata when one says, ‚ÄòWhen that teaching is taught to anyone, it does lead one who practices it to the correct elimination of suffering.‚Äô</p>

<p align="left">‚ÄúSƒÅriputta, this was my carefulness: I was mindful when moving forward and mindful when moving backward, with compassion established in me even towards a drop of water, thinking ‚ÄòMay I not bring harm to the tiny beings who live in uneven ground.‚Äô SƒÅriputta, this was my carefulness.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSƒÅriputta, this was my seclusion: I entered and lived in a particular wilderness domain. When I saw a cow-herder or a shepherd or a grass-collector or a wood-gatherer or a forest worker, then I would flee from grove to grove, from jungle to jungle, from valley to valley, from plateau to plateau. For what reason? So that they would not see me and I would not see them. SƒÅriputta, just as a wild animal, when it sees a human, flees from grove to grove, from jungle to jungle, from valley to valley, from plateau to plateau, in the same way, SƒÅriputta, when I saw a cow-herder or a shepherd or a grass-collector or a wood-gatherer or a forest worker, then I would flee from grove to grove, from jungle to jungle, from valley to valley, from plateau to plateau. For what reason? So that they would not see me and I would not see them. SƒÅriputta, this was my seclusion.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSƒÅriputta, when there was a cow-shed with cows inside and the cowherd had left, then I would approach on all fours and feed on the cow-dung left by young nursing calves. SƒÅriputta, as long as my own urine and excrement did not run out, I lived on my own urine and excrement. SƒÅriputta, this was my practice of eating filth.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSƒÅriputta, I entered and lived in a particular terrifying forest grove ‚Äì a forest grove so terrifying that almost anyone who entered that was not free of lust would find their hair standing on end. SƒÅriputta, during the coldest part of the winter, when snow was falling, I would sit in the open air at night and in the forest grove during the day; and during the hottest part of the summer I would sit in the open air during the day and in the forest grove at night. Then I spoke these spontaneous verses that I had never heard before: ‚ÄòScorched and chilled, alone in the terrifying forest; naked and with no fire to sit beside, the sage is intent upon his quest.‚Äô</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSƒÅriputta, I slept in cemeteries next to bones. Cowherd boys would approach me and spit on me, urinate on me, scatter dirt on me, and put sticks in my ears. However, SƒÅriputta, I do not recall ever producing a harmful mindstate about them. SƒÅriputta, this was my practice of equanimity.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSƒÅriputta, there are some contemplatives and brahmins who profess this perspective: ‚ÄòPurity comes through food.‚Äô They say, ‚ÄòWe will live on <i>kola</i><a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote18sym" name="sdfootnote18anc"><sup>18</sup></a>.‚Äô They eat <i>kola</i>, they eat powdered <i>kola</i>, they drink <i>kola</i> juice ‚Äì they enjoy many kinds of <i>kola </i>products. SƒÅriputta, I recall my food was just one <i>kola </i>[per day]. SƒÅriputta, it is possible that they might think, ‚ÄòAt that time <i>kola</i> must have been very large.‚Äô SƒÅriputta, this is not the way to see it; at that time <i>kola</i> was no bigger than it is now. SƒÅriputta, by eating just one <i>kola</i> [per day], my body became extremely emaciated. Because of eating so little, my limbs became like old, weathered stalks; my buttocks became like a camel‚Äôs hoof; my spine protruded like a string of beads; my ribs stuck out like the broken rafters of an old run-down house; my eyes glittered deep in my eye-sockets like water at the bottom of a deep well; my scalp became as wrinkled and withered as a soft gourd left in the wind and sun. SƒÅriputta, if I wished to touch my stomach, I could feel it through my back; if I wished to touch my spine, I could feel it through my abdomen. SƒÅriputta, because of eating so little, my stomach stuck to my spine. SƒÅriputta, because of eating so little, I would fall over when I tried to defecate or urinate. SƒÅriputta, because of eating so little, the roots of my body-hairs were so rotten that if I rubbed my limbs in order to soothe my body, the hair would fall out.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSƒÅriputta, there are some contemplatives or brahmins who profess this perspective: ‚ÄòPurity comes through food.‚Äô They say, ‚ÄòWe will live on beans‚Ä¶ sesame seeds‚Ä¶ rice&#8230;‚Äô &#8230;because of eating so little, the roots of my body-hairs were so rotten that if I rubbed my limbs in order to soothe my body, the hair would fall out.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSƒÅriputta, I did not attain any superhuman states or any distinction in knowledge and vision that would make me noble by engaging in these behaviors, these practices, and these austerities<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote19sym" name="sdfootnote19anc"><sup>19</sup></a>. For what reason? Because I did not reach any noble wisdom ‚Äì the noble wisdom which, once reached, is a noble guide which guides its enactor to the correct elimination of suffering.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSƒÅriputta, there are some contemplatives or brahmins who profess this perspective: ‚ÄòPurity comes through <i>sa·πÅsƒÅra</i>.‚Äô SƒÅriputta, it is not easy to find any state of being in Sa·πÅsƒÅra which I had not previously experienced during this long cycle of existence, except for the Pure-Abode<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote20sym" name="sdfootnote20anc"><sup>20</sup></a> Devas. SƒÅriputta, had I experienced existence as a Pure-Abode Deva, I would not have returned to this world.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSƒÅriputta, there are some contemplatives or brahmins who profess this perspective: ‚ÄòPurity comes through rebirth.‚Äô SƒÅriputta, it is not easy to find any rebirth which I had not previously been reborn as during this long cycle of existence, except for the Pure-Abode Devas. SƒÅriputta, had I been reborn as a Pure-Abode Deva, I would not have returned to this world.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSƒÅriputta, there are some contemplatives or brahmins who profess this perspective: ‚ÄòPurity comes through living.‚Äô SƒÅriputta, it is not easy to find any life in Sa·πÅsƒÅra which I had not previously lived during this long cycle of existence, except for the Pure-Abode Devas. SƒÅriputta, had I lived as a Pure-Abode Deva, I would not have returned to this world.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSƒÅriputta, there are some contemplatives or brahmins who profess this perspective: ‚ÄòPurity comes through sacrifice.‚Äô SƒÅriputta, it is not easy to find any sacrifice in Sa·πÅsƒÅra which I had not previously sacrificed during this long cycle of existence, when I was a royal anointed king or a wealthy brahmin.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSƒÅriputta, there are some contemplatives or brahmins who profess this perspective: ‚ÄòPurity comes through fire-worship.‚Äô SƒÅriputta, it is not easy to find any fire in Sa·πÅsƒÅra which I had not previously worshiped during this long cycle of existence, when I was a royal anointed king or a wealthy brahmin.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúSƒÅriputta, there are some contemplatives or brahmins who profess this perspective: ‚ÄòAs long as a person is young, youthful, with dark hair, blessed with youth, in the first stage of life ‚Äì then they have the utmost lucidity of wisdom. When this person is decrepit, aged, old, in the last stage of life, eighty or ninety or a hundred years of age ‚Äì then they lose that lucidity of wisdom.‚Äô SƒÅriputta, this is not how it is to be seen. SƒÅriputta, I am now decrepit, aged, old, in the last stage of life; I have lived for eighty years. SƒÅriputta, I might have four disciples who each had a lifespan of one hundred years, who had the utmost mindfulness, perseverance, and steadfastness, and the utmost lucidity of wisdom. SƒÅriputta, just as a strong archer who has trained, practiced, and apprenticed could easily shoot a lightweight arrow across the shadow of a tree, in the same way they have extreme mindfulness, extreme perseverance, and extreme steadfastness. They might repeatedly ask me questions about the establishment of mindfulness, and when asked I would answer, and they would remember my answer; and they would not ask any question twice. SƒÅriputta, except for urinating, defecating, and relieving exhaustion and sleepiness, there would be no end to the TathƒÅgata‚Äôs teaching of the Dhamma, no end to the TathƒÅgata‚Äôs explanations of the Dhamma, no end to the TathƒÅgata‚Äôs answers. Then those four disciples, each with a lifespan of a hundred years, would reach the end of their hundred years and die. SƒÅriputta, even if you have to carry me around on a bed, still there will be no alteration of the TathƒÅgata‚Äôs lucidity of wisdom. SƒÅriputta, one who correctly speaks of someone as ‚ÄòA being who is naturally free of confusion has arisen in the world for the welfare and happiness of many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of devas and humans,‚Äô they would rightly speak of me as ‚ÄòA being who is naturally free of confusion has arisen in the world for the welfare and happiness of many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of devas and humans.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">On this occasion Venerable NƒÅgasamƒÅla was standing behind the Blessed One fanning him. Then Venerable NƒÅgasamƒÅla said to the Blessed One, ‚ÄúWonderful, Bhante! Amazing, Bhante! Bhante, while listening to this Dhamma-teaching my hair stood on end. Bhante, what is the name of this Dhamma-teaching?‚Äù ‚ÄúBecause of that, NƒÅgasamƒÅla, you may remember this Dhamma-teaching as the ‚ÄòHair-Raising Teaching.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">This is what the Blessed One said. Satisfied, Venerable NƒÅgasamƒÅla delighted in the Blessed One‚Äôs speech.</p>
