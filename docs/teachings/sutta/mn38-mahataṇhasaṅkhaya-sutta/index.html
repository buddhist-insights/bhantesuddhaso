<p align="left">Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at SƒÅvatthi, at Jeta&#8217;s Grove, in AnƒÅthapi·πá·∏çika&#8217;s Park. Now on this occasion this kind of harmful perspective had arisen in the mind of a monk named SƒÅti the Fisherman&#8217;s Son: ‚ÄúAs I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, it is this very consciousness which wanders in Sa·πÅsƒÅra, and nothing else.‚Äù Many monks heard: ‚ÄúIt seems that this kind of harmful perspective has arisen in the mind of SƒÅti the Fisherman&#8217;s Son: &#8216;As I understand‚Ä¶ and nothing else.&#8217;‚Äù Then those monks approached SƒÅti Bhikkhu and said to him, ‚ÄúVenerable SƒÅti, is it true that this kind of harmful perspective has arisen in you: &#8216;As I understand‚Ä¶ and nothing else&#8217;?‚Äù ‚ÄúVenerable, it is in this way that I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One: It is this very consciousness which wanders in Sa·πÅsƒÅra, and nothing else.‚Äù Then those monks, wishing to detach SƒÅti Bhikkhu from that harmful perspective, questioned, cross-examined, and interrogated him: ‚ÄúVenerable SƒÅti, don&#8217;t speak in that way. Don&#8217;t misrepresent the Blessed One. It is not good to misrepresent the Blessed One. Venerable SƒÅti, consciousness has been spoken of in many ways by the Blessed One as conditionally arisen<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote1sym" name="sdfootnote1anc"><sup>1</sup></a>. Consciousness does not exist apart from its cause<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote2sym" name="sdfootnote2anc"><sup>2</sup></a>.‚Äù While SƒÅti Bhikkhu was being questioned, cross-examined, and interrogated in this way by those monks, he firmly held to that same harmful perspective, and persistently stated, ‚ÄúVenerable, it is in this way that I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One: It is this very consciousness which wanders in Sa·πÅsƒÅra, and nothing else.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">When those monks were unable to detach SƒÅti Bhikkhu from that harmful perspective, they approached the Blessed One. After approaching and venerating the Blessed One, they sat to one side. While they were seated to one side, those monks said to the Blessed One, ‚ÄúBhante, this kind of harmful perspective has arisen in the mind of a monk named SƒÅti the Fisherman&#8217;s Son: &#8216;As I understand‚Ä¶ and nothing else.&#8217; Bhante, we heard that this kind of harmful perspective had arisen in mind of Sati Bhikkhu: &#8216;As I understand‚Ä¶ and nothing else.&#8217; Then we approached SƒÅti Bhikkhu and said to him, &#8216;Venerable SƒÅti, is it true that this kind of harmful perspective has arisen in you: ‚ÄúAs I understand‚Ä¶ and nothing else‚Äù?&#8217; Bhante, when this was said, SƒÅti Bhikkhu said to us, &#8216;Venerable, it is in this way that I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One: It is this very consciousness which wanders in Sa·πÅsƒÅra, and nothing else.&#8217; Bhante, wishing to detach SƒÅti Bhikkhu from that harmful perspective, we then questioned, cross-examined, and interrogated him: &#8216;Venerable SƒÅti, don&#8217;t speak in that way&#8230; Consciousness does not exist apart from its cause.&#8217; Bhante, while SƒÅti Bhikkhu was being questioned, cross-examined, and interrogated by us in this way, he firmly held to that same harmful perspective, and persistently stated, &#8216;Venerable, it is in this way that I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One: It is this very consciousness which wanders in Sa·πÅsƒÅra, and nothing else.&#8217; Bhante, when we were unable to detach SƒÅti Bhikkhu from that harmful perspective, we reported this matter to the Blessed One.</p>
<p align="left">Then the Blessed One addressed a certain monk: ‚ÄúMonk, go and summon SƒÅti Bhikkhu with my words: &#8216;Venerable SƒÅti, the Teacher summons you.&#8217;‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, Bhante,‚Äù that monk replied the Blessed One. He approached SƒÅti Bhikkhu and said to him, ‚ÄúVenerable SƒÅti, the Teacher summons you.‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, Venerable,‚Äù SƒÅti Bhikkhu replied to that monk, and approached the Blessed One. After approaching and venerating the Blessed One, he sat to one side. When SƒÅti Bhikkhu was seated to one side, the Blessed One said to him, ‚ÄúSƒÅti, is it true that this kind of harmful perspective has arisen in you: &#8216;As I understand‚Ä¶ and nothing else&#8217;?‚Äù ‚ÄúBhante, it is in this way that I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One: It is this very consciousness which wanders in Sa·πÅsƒÅra, and nothing else.‚Äù ‚ÄúSƒÅti, what is that consciousness?‚Äù ‚ÄúBhante, it is what speaks and feels; it is what experiences in various ways the results of good and bad actions.‚Äù ‚ÄúFoolish man<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote3sym" name="sdfootnote3anc"><sup>3</sup></a>, for whom do you recall the Dhamma having been taught by me in that way? Foolish man, haven&#8217;t I spoken of consciousness in many ways as conditionally arisen, [and that] consciousness does not exist apart from its cause? Foolish man, you misrepresent me using your own wrongly held [opinion]. You damage yourself<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote4sym" name="sdfootnote4anc"><sup>4</sup></a> and accumulate much demerit. Foolish man, this will lead to your long-term detriment and suffering.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">Then the Blessed One addressed the monks: ‚ÄúMonks, what do you think: has SƒÅti Bhikkhu kindled even a spark [of understanding] in this Dhamma-Vinaya?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow could it be so, Bhante? Certainly not, Bhante.‚Äù When this was said, SƒÅti Bhikkhu sat silent, ashamed, slouching, face downcast, sullen, unresponsive. Then when the Blessed One knew that SƒÅti Bhikkhu was silent, ashamed, slouching, face downcast, sullen, and unresponsive, he said to SƒÅti Bhikkhu, ‚ÄúFoolish man, you will be known by your own harmful perspective. I will question the [other] monks about this.‚Äù Then the Blessed One addressed the monks: ‚ÄúMonks, do you recall the Dhamma having been taught by me in the way that SƒÅti Bhikkhu misrepresents me using his own wrongly held [opinion], damaging himself and accumulating much demerit?‚Äù ‚ÄúCertainly not, Bhante! Bhante, the Blessed One has spoken to us in many ways of consciousness as conditionally arisen, [and that] consciousness does not exist apart from its cause.‚Äù ‚ÄúGood, good, monks! Monks, it is good that you recall the Dhamma as having been taught by me in that way. Monks, I have spoken to you in many ways of consciousness as conditionally arisen, [and that] consciousness does not exist apart from its cause. However, SƒÅti Bhikkhu misrepresents me using his own wrongly held [opinion], damaging himself and accumulating much demerit. This will lead to that foolish man&#8217;s long-term detriment and suffering.</p>

<p align="left">‚ÄúMonks, when three things come together, conception occurs.

If the mother and father come together and the mother is in season, but a being seeking rebirth is not present, then conception does not occur. If the mother and father come together, the mother is in season, and a being seeking rebirth is present, then since these three things have come together, conception occurs. Monks, for nine or ten months carries the embryo in her womb, with much worry<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote12sym" name="sdfootnote12anc"><sup>12</sup></a>; it is a heavy<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote13sym" name="sdfootnote13anc"><sup>13</sup></a> burden. When it is born, she nourishes it using her own blood. Monks, this is &#8216;blood&#8217; in the discipline of the noble ones: mother&#8217;s milk. Monks, as the child grows and its faculties mature, it plays with a child&#8217;s toys, such as toy plows, toy balls, toy wheels, toy windmills, toy scales, toy vehicles, and toy weapons. Monks, as the child grows and its faculties mature, it enjoys itself using the five kinds of sensuality ‚Äì visible objects cognizable by the eye which are wished for, desired, pleasant, lovable, sensual, and exciting; sounds cognizable by the ear‚Ä¶ fragrances cognizable by the nose‚Ä¶ flavors cognizable by the tongue‚Ä¶ tangible objects cognizable by the body which are wished for, desired, pleasant, lovable, sensual, and exciting.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúWhen it sees a visible object with the eye, it becomes infatuated with the object if the object is lovable, it becomes averse to the object if the object is unlovable, and it abides with mindfulness of the body unestablished and with a limited mind. It does not accurately understand mental liberation and liberation by means of discernment, where these harmful, unskillful phenomena cease without remainder. Engaged in approval and opposition in this way, then whatever feeling it feels ‚Äì pleasant, painful, or neutral ‚Äì it delights in, welcomes, and adheres to that feeling. As it delights in, welcomes, and adheres to that feeling, delight arises. Delight in regard to feelings is [a form of] clinging. When there is clinging, there is existence. When there is existence, there is birth. When there is birth, there is old age and dieing; and sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish come to be. In this way there is the arising of this entire mass of suffering.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúHere, monks, the TathƒÅgata<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote14sym" name="sdfootnote14anc"><sup>14</sup></a> arises in the world ‚Äì the Worthy One, the Rightly Self-Awakened One, perfect in knowledge and conduct, sublime<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote15sym" name="sdfootnote15anc"><sup>15</sup></a>, the world-knower, the unsurpassed trainer of trainable people, teacher of angels<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote16sym" name="sdfootnote16anc"><sup>16</sup></a> and humans, enlightened and blessed.

He makes known the thoroughly complete and absolutely pure holy life. That Dhamma is heard by a householder, a householder&#8217;s child, or a person born in a certain family. After hearing that Dhamma, he acquires faith in the TathƒÅgata. With that acquisition of faith, he reflects in this way: &#8216;The household life is cramped and dirty; the renunciate life is [like] the open air. While living the household life, it is not easy to follow the Holy Life, which is completely perfect and pure, like a polished shell. Perhaps I should shave off my hair and beard, put on brown robes, and go forth form the household life into homelessness.&#8217; At a later occasion he abandons a small or large mass of wealth, he abandons a small or large circle of relatives, he shaves off his hair and beard, puts on brown robes, and goes forth from the household life into homelessness.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúWhen he has become a renunciate in this way, and is endowed with the training and lifestyle of a monk, he abandons killing and abstains from killing; he abides as one who has set aside cudgel and sword, who is conscientious and compassionate, one who wishes for the welfare of all living beings.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúHe abandons stealing and abstains from stealing. He takes only what is given, he expects only what is given, he abides cleanly, free of theft.</p>

<p align="left">‚ÄúHe is content with a robe to take care of his body and alms-food to take care of his stomach. Wherever he goes, he goes with only these. Just as wherever a winged bird goes, it goes weighed down only by its feathers, in the same way a monk is content with a robe to take care of his body and alms-food to take care of his stomach. Wherever he goes, he goes with only these. Endowed with this noble collection of virtues, he experiences the internal happiness of blamelessness.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote22sym" name="sdfootnote22anc"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúWhen he sees a visible object with the eye, he does not grasp at its characteristics or details.

He abandons covetousness in regard to the world, and abides with a mind free of covetousness; he purifies his mind of covetousness. He abandons aversion and hatred, and abides with a mind free of aversion; he wishes for the welfare of all living beings, and purifies his mind of aversion and hatred. He abandons dullness and torpor, and abides free of dullness and torpor, percipient of light; mindful and completely aware, he purifies his mind of dullness and torpor. He abandons restlessness and remorse, and abides unagitated, with a mind that is internally peaceful; he purifies his mind of restlessness and remorse. He abandons doubt, and abides as one who has gone beyond doubt, who is free of confusion about skillful phenomena; he purifies the mind of doubt.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúWhen he has abandoned these five hindrances ‚Äì defilements of the mind that weaken wisdom ‚Äì then, secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful phenomena, he attains and remains in the first <i>jhƒÅna</i><a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote25sym" name="sdfootnote25anc"><sup>25</sup></a>, which has thought and consideration, and has rapture and pleasure produced by seclusion. With the calming of thought and consideration, and with internal composure and mental focus, he attains and remains in the second <i>jhƒÅna</i>, which is free of thought and free of consideration, and has rapture and pleasure born from concentration. With the fading away of rapture, SƒÅriputta remains equanimous, mindful, and clearly comprehending, and experiences pleasure with the body; he attains and remains in the third <i>jhƒÅna,</i> which the noble ones describe as &#8216;Equanimous, mindful, and dwelling happily.&#8217; With the abandoning of pleasure, the abandoning of pain, and the prior disappearance of elation and depression, SƒÅriputta attains and remains in the fourth <i>jhƒÅna</i>, which has neither pain nor pleasure, and has purity due to mindfulness and equanimity.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúWhen he sees a visible object with the eye, if it is an agreeable object he does not become infatuated with it, and if it is a disagreeable object he does not become averse it; he abides with mindfulness of the body established and with an immeasurable<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote26sym" name="sdfootnote26anc"><sup>26</sup></a> mind. He accurately understands that liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom where those harmful, unskillful phenomena cease without remainder. When he has abandoned approval and opposition in this way, then whatever feeling he feels ‚Äì pleasant, painful, or neutral ‚Äì he does not delight in that feeling, he does not welcome it, and he does not adhere to it. Since he does not delight in, welcome, or adhere to that feeling, then delight in regard to feelings ceases. From the cessation of his delight there is the cessation of clinging. From the cessation of clinging there is the cessation of existence. From the cessation of existence there is the cessation of birth. From the cessation of birth there is the cessation of old age and dieing; and sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish cease. In this way there is the cessation of this entire mass of suffering.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúWhen he hears a sound with the ear‚Ä¶ smells a fragrance with the nose.. tastes a flavor with the tongue‚Ä¶ touches a tangible object with the body‚Ä¶ cognizes a thought with the mind, if it is an agreeable object he does not become infatuated with it‚Ä¶ In this way there is the cessation of this entire mass of suffering.</p>
<p align="left">‚ÄúMonks, remember this as liberation by means of the complete elimination of craving, that has been briefly [explained] by me. However, SƒÅti Bhikkhu is not free from a tangled mass of craving, from the net of craving.‚Äù</p>
<p align="left">This is what the Blessed One said. Satisfied, those monks delighted in the Blessed One&#8217;s speech.</p>
