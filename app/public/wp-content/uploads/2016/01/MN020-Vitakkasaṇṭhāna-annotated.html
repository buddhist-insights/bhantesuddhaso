attempting to practice meditation, we experience unwholesome and
distracting thoughts of various kinds: thoughts about what we want,
thoughts about what we dislike, speculative thoughts, meandering
thoughts… as soon as we notice that we have gotten off track in
this manner, then it is time to reestablish the mind's focus.  The
first method the Buddha provides in this discourse is to replace
whatever we were focusing on with something else.  So if focusing
your mind on attractive members of your preferred gender leads to
thoughts of sexual desire – thus breaking your concentration –
then it's time to switch your mind to something else that will not
provoke the mind in that way.  Or if recollecting the mistreatment
you've been given by others leads to anger and resentment towards
those people, then once again, it is time to focus your mind on
something else.</i></font></p>

overcome by a strong negative emotion, as they work to directly
oppose particular unwholesome tendencies.  However, be careful with
these techniques; developing thoughts of loving-friendliness towards
a person that you are sexually attracted to can provoke lust, and
contemplating the unattractiveness of the body can provoke aversion. 
Carefully pay attention to the effect that such meditation objects
are having on the mind, and pick something else to focus on if the
present object is leading in an unwholesome direction.  If used
correctly, however, these are wholesome objects of awareness because
they encourage the development of loving-friendliness, compassion,
renunciation, and contentment.</i></font></p>
